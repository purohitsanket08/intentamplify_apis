Task: To build a website which contains a landing page, a home page, contact us page and a
payment page(so only 4 pages).

1. Landing page: a landing page should basically be a page where user can login, register,
change password with proper validations and user password protection(encryption) and at
the same time the data should get saved in the database(mysql). Any design on the landing
page is not mandatory at all.

2. Home page: once the user clicks on login after his successful registration, he should be
redirected to the home page (which the candidate has to make by his own). The home page
should look exactly same but assets can be different (for example:- In place of Intent
Amplify logo put some random logo, similarly instead of the normal video put some random
video and similarly for images you can put random images) as the Intent amplify web
page(https://intentamplify.com/). On the home page in the navigation bar after you click on
the get in touch button, the user should be redirected to the contact us page where user will
be able to fill the contact form and note that after filling the contact form once the user
clicks on the submit button the form data should get saved in the database.

3. Home page: on the home page in the navigation bar add a new component next to brands
component. Name the component as ‘Payment’. If the user clicks on the payment
component then he should get directed to the payment page. So this payment page should
work like a dummy payment page using razor pay/or any other payment gateway. At the
same time the payment data should get saved in the database.

Note: On the Home page only get in touch and payment (which the candidate has to add by
himself in the navigation bar) should be clickable and rest all is not mandatory to make it
clickable. The page should be responsive for mobile and tablets also.
